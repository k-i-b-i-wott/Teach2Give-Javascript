# Data Types

avaScript has the following basic data types which are also the primitive data types in JavaScript (more about this later):

<ul>
    <li>String</li>  
    <li>Number</li>
    <li>null</li>
    <li>undefined</li>
    <li>Bigint</li>
    <li>Symbol</li>
    

</ul>



## String

Refers to a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes ('), double quotes (") or backticks.

```js
let firstName = "john";
let lastName = "doe";
let username = `john_doe`;

```
## Number

JavaScript has only one type for numbers: it can store both integers and decimals.

```js
let age = 25; // Integer
let price = 99.99; // Decimal
let notANumber = NaN; // Not a Number (invalid math operation)

```

## Boolean

Booleans represent true or false values, often used for decision-making.

Boolean can either be true or false.

```js
let isMale = true;
let isFemale = false;

```

## Undefined


Refers to a variable that has been declared but not initialized

```js
let country;
console.log(country); // Output: undefined

```
### Null

Null is an intentional absence of a value. Unlike undefined, which means "not assigned," null means "empty on purpose."

```js 
let car = null; // No car yet

```
 ## BigInt


 sed for numbers beyond JavaScriptâ€™s Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER (9,007,199,254,740,991).

 ```js
 let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n; // "n" at the end makes it a BigInt
console.log(bigNumber);

```

## Checking the type of a variable using the `typeof` operator

You can check the type of a variable using the typeof operator in JavaScript.

```js 
let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n;
console.log(typeof bigNumber); // bigint
// OR
console.log(typeof bigNumber); // bigint

const age = 25;
const fullName = "John Doe";

console.log(typeof age); // number
console.log(typeof fullName); // string


```
