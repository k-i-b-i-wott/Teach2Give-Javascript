# Let and const for block scoped variables

Block scoped variables are declared using the `let` and `const` keywords.

Before ES6, Javascript only had function scopes and global scope which led to issues like variable hoisting.

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are block scoped.

`let`declarations are not hoisted.(default behavior of moving functions and variables to declarations to the top of the scope), the function declarations can be called before they appear in the code .


`const` allows you to declare a variable with a constant value.

`const` declarations are not hoisted.

`const` variable cannot be changed after the assignment.
